#### Alpha YouTube Downloader is a python script for downloading audios and and videos from YouTube, You Provide The URL, and AYD serves you with the desired file :) 
pros:
- You can download videos and musics for free, no charge, no ad, no disturbance
- safe and trusted, you can observe and investigate the whole code, nothing is hidden from your eyes
- acceptably fast, if your internet connection is not slow as ..., turtle! 
    
cons:
- you can't chose the resolution :(, all the videos are available as 720p
- not visually perfect, a nice GUI would be better I don't want to argue
- probably not very user-friendly, especially for those who don't use CLI programs very often
- you need python Installed, plus all of its dependencies, which I think is the biggest cons so far :(

overall I think it is still useful, not for everyone, but for those like me that already has python installed, doesn't care about nice UI or using CLI programs,
and doesn't want to pay, see ads, or risk for downloading a video.

#### but that doesn't mean I don't have plans for making it better, but I could use some help :), would be very cool if you guys help me, I would really appreciate, thank for helping, or even using AYD :)
